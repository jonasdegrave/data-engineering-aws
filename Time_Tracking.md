# Activities (Done):

- Everything (code, docs, etc.) are to be in version control. It's up to you
  how you'd like to organize it just as long as you can add me to a repo.

Initialized GitHub repository for version control;

- Implement an HTTP server using any technology you'd like.

Imported Swagger directives into a Python Flask http server;

- Implement the infrastructure in a one-off way by just using the
  AWS console. Clicking buttons FTW!

Done and running!

- Deploy the http server to the cloud.

Deployed Flask into AWS EC2 via SSH + Git;

- Write good documentation

Documentation.md file documents the overall process.

- Have some very basic tests showing the system works.

Tests via Swagger UI confirm all HTTP Requests are working. Future: implement Pytest (?)

# Activities (Planned):

- Implement the infrastructure in terraforms and ansibles do that it can be deployed
  in as few commands as possible

Upcoming...
