# Day 1 :

## Time Data

* Begin: 21h00 (UTC-3)

* End: TBD

* Time Spent: TBD

## Activities (Planned):

- Everything (code, docs, etc.) are to be in version control. It's up to you
  how you'd like to organize it just as long as you can add me to a repo.

Initialized GitHub repository for version control;

- Implement an HTTP server using any technology you'd like.

Imported Swagger directives into a Python Flask http server;

- Implement the infrastructure in a one-off way by just using the
  AWS console. Clicking buttons FTW!

Skipping this part, straight to Terraform. Buttons FTL :)

- Deploy the http server to the cloud.

Deployed Flask into a Docker container in AWS EC2;

- Have some very basic tests showing the system works.

Performing API unit tests using Insomnia;
