# Documentation - Data Engineering - AWS DataLake

TL;DR:

This documentation file describes the process that has been followed through to implement the scalable HTTP api that writes raw data to
a data lake in AWS S3.


# Implement an HTTP server using any technology you'd like.

Describe usage of Python Flask for this


# Implement the infrastructure in a one-off way by just using the AWS console. Clicking buttons FTW!

Describe the AWS infrastructure setup


# Deploy the http server to the cloud.

Describe process of setting up HTTP Server in EC2 instance

# Everything (code, docs, etc.) are to be in version control. It's up to you how you'd like to organize it just as long as you can add me to a repo.

Describe usage of Git in the project


# Have some very basic tests showing the system works.

Describe HTTP Requests testing features


# Implement the infrastructure in terraforms and ansibles do that it can be deployed in as few commands as possible.

TBD


# Write good documentation.
